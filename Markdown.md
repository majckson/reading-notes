# Markdown

A few things I've learned about markdown

+ if you want to italize script add an asterisk before and after the words that you want affected
+ if you want to bold script add two asterisks before and after the words that you want affected
+ for an un ordered list use the plus sign, asterisk, or dash before the items you want affected
