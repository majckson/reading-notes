# Markdown

A few things I've learned about markdown

+ if you want to italize script add an asterisk before and after the words that you want affected
+ if you want to bold script add two asterisks before and after the words that you want affected
+ for an un ordered list use the plus sign, asterisk, or dash before the items you want affected


# Learning Markdown

## What is Markdown?
Coding language used on the GitHub platform. Similar to HTML but doesn't have as much capability. It is primarily used for documentation. 

## Examples and Syntax Guide

### Headings
Use #-###### for headings, make sure you include a space after the last # symbol. 
**Reminder**: Use just one h1 heading per page. 

### Italics, Bold, and Strikethrough
Italics can be done two ways. Here is *italics* and here is _italics_ as well.
Bold can also be done two ways. Here is **bold** and here is __bold__ as well.

Choose one of these styles for each, and stay consistent within your project. 

We can also strikethrough any word like ~~this~~. 

### Lists

#### Unordered Lists
There are three ways to do ordered lists. You can use these three ways:
* List item 1
* List item 2
  * Nested list item 1
    * Nested list item 2

- List item 1
- List item 2

* List item 1
* List item 2

#### Ordered Lists
There is one specific way to create ordered lists:
1. List item 1
1. List item 2
1. List item 3
   1. Nested list item 1
      1. Nested list item 2

### Images
We can also insert and display images using the following code:
![Image Name](URL to image)
![CodeFellowsLogo](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*MghnV-Q6kiAeO-ZQQreitA.png)

### Links
We can insert links as well. Using the following code:
[Text to appear](URl to link)
For example, here's a great guide for [mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Quotes
We can include quotes like this one by Eleanor Roosevelt:
> Do one thing every day that scares you.

### Inline Code
We can include code text in our documents as well. For example:
```html
<head>
  <title>Example title for our code</title>
</head>
```
Or, another example:
I think we might need a `<p>` here. 

### Task Lists
We can include checklists as well.
- [x] complete item 1
- [x] complete item 2
- [ ] incomplete item 1
- [ ] incomplete item 2

### Tables
Here is an example for a table in markdown:
First Header | Second Header | Third Header
------ | ------ | ------
Content from cell 1 | Cell 2 | Cell 3
Content in first column | second column | third column
