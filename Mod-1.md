## What is *growth* mindset?

Growth mindset is the belief that you can grow and change through application, exercise, and a lot of hard work.

Things I can do to keep in the growth mindset
- Remind myself that I can do it.
- Failing is a fundamental part of learning, do not get discouraged. Lean into trying something new and potential failure, you'll learn more! Stay positive and believe in yourself that you will figure it out.
- If I get stuck, get up and take a few minutes away from the problem. Come back to it refreshed and with a fresh perspective.

> Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. 
> The most certain way to succeed is always to try one more time.  -Thomas Edison
