# Reading Notes

## HTML

### Chapter 5: “Images” 

[Jon Duckett](http://htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-05/)

* The `<img>` element is used to add images to a web page
* You must always specify an src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image
* You should save images at the size you will be using the; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

### Chapter 11: “Color” 

[Jon Duckett](http://htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-11/)

* Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
* Color pickers can help you to find the color you want.
* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any test and the background color (otherwise people will not be abm on the web page and in the appropriate format.
* Photographs are best saved as JPEGsle to read your content)

### Chapter 12: “Text”

[Jon Duckett](http://htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-12/)

* There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.
* There's a limited choice of fonts that you can assure most people will have installed.
* If you want to use a wider range of typerfaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
* You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words, Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, of justified. It can also be indented,
* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
